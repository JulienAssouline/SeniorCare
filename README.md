# Seniorcare

Seniorcare is a full stack mobile application for the client Senior Care Connect, which was built with five other developers. The stack we used was React Native, Redux, Apollo, GraphQL, Express, and PostgreSQL.

I built the chat which uses subscriptions to send results every time a particular event happens (exp. a message).

I also built the search page, along with the filter.

Then I helped another classmate with the profile and profile edit pages.

For all features, I was a part of I worked on both the frontend and backend.
